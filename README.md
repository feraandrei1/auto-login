## Auto-login Bot

This bot will help you in automatically logging in your account of the desired website or webpage you want. It basically saves time and energy of typing the username and password again and again.

## How to use

1. Enter the website you want to login, your username and your password in the script.py.

2. Now go to the website/webpage and open the developer Tools/Inspect element option. There search the HTML code corresponding to the HTML input fields of username, password and submit button as well. Copy the name (or class or id) of that element and paste it in the python code. Firstly, you can try login to Github to test the code.

3. Download the Chrome Driver and install it. Install more requirements if is necessary. Run script.py.

## Info

Info : You can also set in how much time to stop the browser at "time.sleep()" from script.py.
